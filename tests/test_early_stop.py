"""Deterministic repro + regression gate for the "half-applied commit reconcile on early stop"
data-loss bug. Headless: no mic, no focused field.

THE BUG (Elias-reported): dictate "...we grab the logs"; the LLM wants grab->grep on the final
clause; double-tap LEFT Command to STOP the instant the last word is out — i.e. before the grep fix
finishes applying. The commit reconcile (overlay backspace-then-retype, or the smart min-edit span
replace) is a DESTRUCTIVE phase (backspace old chars) followed by a CONSTRUCTIVE phase (type new
chars). If a stop/teardown cuts it in the middle, the backspaces land but the retype doesn't, leaving
a truncated tail like "...we gr".

WHY a stop can cut it (mapped in live.py):
  * stop() runs on the pynput listener thread: running.clear() -> (drain in-flight reconcile)
    -> stream.close() -> worker.join().
  * The worker thread, on seeing `running` cleared, exits its `while running.is_set()` loop and
    falls into the flush block (end of _consume) which calls commit() one last time -> the overlay
    reconcile.
  * The worker is a DAEMON thread. If the process exits (Ctrl-C/SIGTERM, or join(timeout) elapses
    and main() returns) WHILE the reconcile is mid-flight, the daemon is killed abruptly between the
    backspace and the type.

TWO THINGS THIS FILE PROVES
  (1) PRIMITIVE (documentation of the failure mode): an UNGUARDED reconcile cut at the
      backspace->type seam half-applies — and DUM_MIN_EDIT only SHRINKS the loss (whole tail ->
      one diff span), it does NOT make it atomic. This is asserted, so if someone "fixes" it by
      tweaking min-edit alone, this test still shows the half-apply is possible at the primitive.
  (2) ORCHESTRATION (the actual fix): the live.py `_reconcile_lock` barrier means stop()/teardown
      WAITS for an in-flight reconcile to finish as one atomic unit before tearing down — so the
      ON-SCREEN result is always atomic (full grep fix, or untouched original), never a truncation.
      Tested with REAL threads in the racing interleave, and proven NOT to deadlock (bounded drain).

# in-flight reconcile, so the on-screen result is ATOMIC. Real threads, real racing interleave.
#
# This faithfully models live.py:
#   * a daemon "worker" runs the flush-commit reconcile, holding `_reconcile_lock` for the whole
#     destructive+constructive insertion (live.py commit());
#   * stop() clears `running`, then uses the lock as a BARRIER (acquire+release, bounded) before
#     "tearing down" — and never KILLS the worker, it joins it.
# We force the worst interleave (stop fires DURING the reconcile) with events, and assert the
# reconstructed on-screen buffer is atomic. We also assert no deadlock and a bounded drain.
