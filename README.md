Ok real talk: this is Apple Dictation, except it doesn't butcher your tech words. It gets `git`,
`kubectl`, `nginx`, `PostgreSQL`, `TanStack Query` and friends right, where normal dictation hears
"get hub" or "engine x". It runs on your machine and types into whatever app you're in.

> [Discussions](https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation/discussions) or an

## What you need

- **macOS** (Apple Silicon, M-series) - the primary, best-tested platform
- **Windows 10/11** - tested and working. See [On Windows](#on-windows) below.
- **Linux** (X11) - experimental. See [On Linux](#on-linux) below.
- Python 3.12

## Install (macOS)

One command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation/main/install.sh | bash
```

That clones the repo into `./dum-dictation` and runs `./setup`, which makes a virtualenv,
installs the deps, and downloads the speech model + the on-device correction model. Afterwards
you grant a few macOS permissions once - see [Permissions](#permissions-one-time---mac-makes-you-do-this)
right below.

Prefer not to pipe curl into bash? Same thing, by hand:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation.git
cd dum-dictation
./setup
```

**On Windows or Linux?** Jump to [On Windows](#on-windows) or [On Linux](#on-linux) - the
one-liner above is macOS-only.

## Permissions (one time - Mac makes you do this)

Dictation literally can't work without these, so don't skip it. The app you need to grant them to
is **whatever app you ran `./dum` from** - Terminal, iTerm, or the VS Code terminal. (If you run it
in the VS Code terminal, you grant them to **Visual Studio Code**.)

The first time you run `./dum`, macOS will pop these up on its own - just click **Allow** / **Open
System Settings**. If it doesn't, set them by hand: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**,
then for each of the three, find your terminal app in the list and flip the switch **on**:

1. **Microphone** => so it can hear you
2. **Accessibility** => so it can type into whatever app you're focused on
3. **Input Monitoring** => so it can catch the double-tap-Command hotkey

⚠️ **Then fully quit your terminal app and reopen it.** macOS only applies the new permissions to a
fresh launch - this is the step everyone forgets, and dictation stays silent until you do it.

<!-- Optional but recommended for non-technical friends: add 3 small screenshots of the toggles.
Drop them in docs/ as docs/perm-mic.png, docs/perm-accessibility.png, docs/perm-input.png and
reference them here. The grant step is where most people get stuck. -->

Stuck? The most common cause of "it runs but types nothing" is forgetting to **quit and reopen**
the terminal after granting Accessibility.

## Using it

```sh
./dum
```

Double-tap the **LEFT Command (⌘)** key to start talking, double-tap again to stop. Words show up
live as you speak, and when you pause it cleans up the sentence and locks it in. Ctrl+C to quit.

Need a different mic?

```sh
DUM_MIC="MacBook Air" ./dum     # by name (survives device-index shuffles)
./dum --mic 1                    # by index (list them: .venv/bin/python src/live.py --list-devices)
```

### Run it like a real app (menu bar + auto-start)

Don't want to babysit a terminal? Add `--tray` and dum lives in your **menu bar** - a
little dot (green = listening, grey = idle) with **Start/Stop** and **Quit**. The hotkey
still works the same.

```sh
./dum --tray
```

To have it **start by itself at login** (and quietly relaunch if it ever crashes):

```sh
./dum --install-autostart      # set it up   (also: --autostart-status)
./dum --uninstall-autostart    # undo it
```

After the first auto-start, macOS re-asks for Microphone / Accessibility / Input
Monitoring - this time for the venv's `python` (a login item isn't your terminal). Grant
those three once and log out/in. Running a second copy is refused automatically - one
robot owns the mic and hotkey.

## On Windows

> ✅ **Tested and working on Windows 10/11** (a contributor ran it on real hardware).

Same idea, same tech-vocab smarts - it types into any focused Windows app (VS Code, the
Claude Code box, Chrome, Slack, a WSL terminal). The homophone LLM (`grep`/`grab`,
`git`/`get`) runs on Windows too via the portable llama.cpp backend (the same model as
Mac), so you get the full phonetic + alias + LLM stack.

In **PowerShell** (Python 3.12 from python.org on your PATH):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation.git
cd dum-dictation
.\setup.ps1
.\dum.ps1
```

`.\setup.ps1` makes the venv, installs the deps (the Mac-only wheels are skipped; `pywin32`
is added) and downloads the speech model. The only permission is the **microphone**:
Settings → Privacy & security → Microphone → let desktop apps use it. No Accessibility /
Input-Monitoring step like macOS.

Double-tap the **RIGHT Ctrl** key to start/stop (change it with `.\dum.ps1 --config`).
Want the tray icon and start-at-logon?

```powershell
.\dum.ps1 --tray               # tray icon, no console window
.\dum.ps1 --install-autostart  # start at logon + relaunch on crash (Task Scheduler)
.\dum.ps1 --uninstall-autostart
```

> Running in WSL? Dictation needs the real keyboard, mic and screen - which Windows owns -
> so install and run the **Windows** version above. It still types straight into your WSL
> terminal (and through it, into anything you've SSH'd to). You don't install dum inside WSL
> or on a remote server; it lives on the machine in front of you.

## On Linux

> ⚠️ **Experimental.** The code is all here and should work, but it's the least-tested path.

**Linux is untested - I'm looking for a contributor!** If you run Linux and want to help make this
solid, that would mean a lot. [Open an issue](https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation/issues/new),
[start a discussion](https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation/discussions), or reach me on GitHub
[@eliasmocik](https://github.com/eliasmocik).

Same again, for a Linux **desktop** you sit in front of (not a headless server - there's no mic
or screen to dictate into there). It uses the standard X11 tools:

```sh
sudo apt install xdotool xclip      # (or your distro's equivalent; wl-clipboard for Wayland)
git clone https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation.git
cd dum-dictation
./setup                              # skips the Apple-only LLM automatically
./dum                                # double-tap RIGHT Ctrl to start/stop
./dum --tray                         # tray icon
./dum --install-autostart            # systemd --user service (start at login + relaunch on crash)
```

Typing is layout-independent via `xdotool type` (so a Slovak/dead-key layout isn't mangled);
clipboard paste uses `xclip` or `wl-clipboard`. If those tools aren't installed it still runs,
just degraded (types via a generic backend, no focus guard).

> **Wayland:** the typing/clipboard tools above are X11. Under a pure Wayland session, run under
> XWayland or install `ydotool` + `wl-clipboard`. This is the least-tested path - X11 is the
> smooth one for now.

## Privacy

Everything stays on your machine. There's an
optional local-only log (off by default) that remembers what you dictated so the misheard words
can get fixed over time, but it never leaves your computer and `dogfood/` is gitignored. The full
breakdown is in [`docs/DOGFOOD.md`](docs/DOGFOOD.md).

## Want to help?

**Easiest thing (10 seconds):** tell me if it stuck or if you bounced. Did setup work? Did it get
your words right? Did you still have it on a week later? Drop it in
[Discussions](https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation/discussions) or
[open an issue](https://github.com/eliasmocik/dum-dictation/issues/new). Blunt is fine - "the setup
broke here" or "it kept hearing X as Y" is exactly what I need.

**Next most useful:** a vocab fix (a word it keeps getting wrong). Ideally read
[`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), but the general-vs-personal rule is the whole deal.
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) shows how the pipeline fits together and
[`docs/DEV-NOTES.md`](docs/DEV-NOTES.md) has the dev loop.
