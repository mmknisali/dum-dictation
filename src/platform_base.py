Platform I/O surface — the ONE place OS-specific behaviour lives, so Linux/Windows
are a drop-in later instead of a retrofit.

The rest of the stack is already portable by construction:
  * inference  — Parakeet via sherpa-onnx (ONNX runtime), not MLX, so the engine
                 isn't Mac-locked; the optional homophone LLM (MLX) sits behind the
                 pipeline `Stage` interface and can be swapped for a GGUF/llama.cpp
                 backend on other platforms with no core change.
  * audio in   — sounddevice (PortAudio): cross-platform.
  * hotkey     — pynput global hotkey: cross-platform.
  * overlay typing — pynput keyboard (type + backspace): cross-platform.

Only three things are actually OS-specific, and they live here behind `Platform`:
  * paste(text)        — put text at the cursor via the clipboard
  * notify(event)      — start/done/empty sound cue
  * frontmost_app()    — focused-app name, for the overlay focus guard

MacPlatform (Quartz/AppKit), WindowsPlatform (SendInput + win32clipboard + winsound +
GetForegroundWindow) and LinuxPlatform (xdotool + xclip/wl-clipboard + a bell) are implemented.
FallbackPlatform is the last resort for any other OS (types via pynput, no sounds, focus guard
off) so the app at least starts; LinuxPlatform itself degrades to that same behaviour when the
X11 CLI tools aren't present (e.g. a bare Wayland session — see its docstring).

Note the native platforms override type_text too (not just paste/notify/frontmost): pynput types
through the active keyboard layout, so a dead-key layout mangles output — instead they post raw
Unicode (CGEvent on mac, SendInput KEYEVENTF_UNICODE on Windows, `xdotool type` on Linux/X11).
