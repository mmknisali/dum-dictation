MVP-0 (Path A) - the LIVE dictation app.

Continuous mic capture -> energy VAD (sentence boundaries at pauses) ->
streaming Parakeet (growing-window, reset per sentence) -> the correction
pipeline (phonetic + optional gated LLM + the inert paid seam) -> paste the
COMMITTED sentence at the cursor.

This is the real-time sibling of prototype.py: the prototype proved the loop on
WAV files (silence-split + growing-window streaming + dictionary correction);
this drives the exact same core from a live microphone and types into whatever
app is focused - made for dictating into a terminal or editor to drive a
coding agent. It reuses dum's paste-at-cursor + beep trick.

Design notes:
  * The audio callback only ENQUEUES frames; a single consumer thread does all
    transcription, so the recognizer is touched from one thread and capture can
    never block. If transcription falls behind, previews are skipped (never
    audio) - the commit transcription always runs.
  * VAD is an adaptive noise-floor energy gate (zero extra deps, same idea as
    prototype.segment_by_silence). Speech = dBFS > floor + margin. A sentence
    commits after MIN_SIL_S of trailing silence, or at MAX_SEG_S (bounded compute).
  * Preview is logged to the terminal only - it is NOT pasted (typing+deleting a
    flickering preview into a shell is hostile). Only corrected, committed
    sentences are pasted.

Run (immediate, safe - log only, nothing pasted):
    .venv/bin/python live.py --no-paste
Run (paste at cursor, immediate continuous listen until Ctrl+C):
    .venv/bin/python live.py
Run (toggle daemon: tap the hotkey to start/stop continuous dictation):
    .venv/bin/python live.py --hotkey
Run (macOS-style: double-tap LEFT Command to start/stop, globally):
    .venv/bin/python live.py --double-cmd --overlay --llm
Run (menu-bar daily driver - same hotkey, tray icon instead of a babysat terminal):
    .venv/bin/python live.py --double-cmd --overlay --llm --tray
Run (word-by-word live overlay - types as you speak, reconciles on pause):
    .venv/bin/python live.py --overlay
Run (overlay DRY - prints the type/backspace ops, types nothing; safe to watch):
    .venv/bin/python live.py --overlay --no-paste
Auto-start at login (launchd login item; relaunches on crash):
    .venv/bin/python live.py --install-autostart   # also: --uninstall-autostart / --autostart-status
Options: --overlay  --llm  --tray  --mic <idx|name>  --list-devices  --margin <dB>
A single live instance is enforced (mic + global hotkey are single-owner); a 2nd exits.

Env (shared with dum where it makes sense):
    DUM_MIC / DICTATE_MIC   mic index or name substring (default: system default)
    DUM_HOTKEY              global toggle key (default <ctrl>+<alt>+d)
    DUM_VAD_MARGIN         dB above noise floor counted as speech (default 12)
    DUM_MIN_SIL            seconds of silence that ends a sentence (default 0.6)
    DUM_VOCAB_DIR          extra *.txt vocab packs       (SEAM 2)
    DUM_EVENTS             append-only JSONL event sink   (SEAM 3)
    DUM_EXTERNAL_CORRECTOR paid corrector command (stdio) (SEAM 1; unset = off)
    DUM_FOCUS_GUARD=0      disable the focus-away hard stop (see focus_guard.py)
